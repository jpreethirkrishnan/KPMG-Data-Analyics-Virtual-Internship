TASK 1:
DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Identifying the data quality issues in the client dataset and ensure it's accurate complete and reliable.

I make sure this data is error-free and adheres to the data quality for further insights and trend analysis.

ABOUT THE DATASET:
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation. It needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy. 

It has 3 datasets:

Customer Demographic 
Customer Addresses
Transactions data in the past 3 months

I started the data quality check in the 3 given datasets and documented my points in the word doc named 'Task1_Data quality check'.

I'am using Excel for data quality check.



TASK 2:
DATA INSIGHTS

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has given a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation. 

Task is to analyze the data that would reveal useful customer insights which could help optimise resource allocation for targeted marketing.Hence, improve performance by focusing on high value customers.


For this task, I analysed by creating pivot tables and the analysis can be found in the tabs 'pivot_transactions' and  'pivot_customers'.

Insights and Conclusion - 

Finally, I recommend the SProcket central team to concentrate and Target the sales in these areas - 

1. The New South Wales State.
2. Customers with DOB below 1980
3. More stock on medium product class type.
4. Top 3 selling brands - Solex, WeareA2B and Giant Bicycles.
